						<a name="bengal"> <h1> Bengal cat </h1> </a>
						<p> Don’t get a Bengal if what you’re looking for is a sweet, gentle lap cat or a living sculpture that requires little interaction. The intelligent, curious Bengal is highly active. Constantly on the move, he loves climbing to high places, enjoys playing fetch and going for walks on leash... </p>
						<p> Some Bengals are fond of playing in water, and you may find yours fishing out of the aquarium if you’re not careful. This is a happy, entertaining cat who wants lots of attention. He does best with a person who spends a lot of time at home and will enjoy playing and interacting with him. </p>
						<p> The short coat is easy to groom with weekly brushing. Trim the nails as needed. </p>

							<h3> Cat's temperament and personality</h3>
							<p> Bengals are a lot of fun to live with, but they’re definitely not the cat for everyone, or for first-time cat owners. Extremely intelligent, curious and active, they demand a lot of interaction and woe betide the owner who doesn’t provide it. </p>
							<p> The Bengal loves his people and will do anything for attention from them. If he figures out that you don’t like something he does — jumping on the kitchen counter, for instance — he will start doing it all the time because it will get your attention and force you to interact with him. He also likes to take things and hide them. Put your jewelry away in a place where he can’t get it (you hope). </p>
							<p> This is a cat who needs a lot of vertical territory. Bengals love to climb, the higher the better. Provide them with tall cat trees and window perches. They are also fond of playing water. You may find yourself installing a motion-sensitive faucet in your bathroom or kitchen so he can turn the water on and off for himself. If that’s not on your agenda, he will appreciate having a pet fountain to drink from. </p>

							<p> Most Bengals get along with other pets, including dogs. They are best suited to homes with older children who will enjoy playing with them, but as long as they have an escape route from toddlers they should do well with them. </p>
							
							<h3> Grooming </h3>
							<p> Bengals have a short, luxurious, soft coat that is easy to care for with weekly brushing. He will love the attention, and if you brush him more often you will find fewer dust bunnies and hairballs around the house. </p>

						<p> The Maine Coon is a big lug. He has a muscular, big-boned body and weighs 9 to 18 pounds. You may have heard tell of 30-pound behemoths, but any Maine Coon that reaches that size is probably grossly overweight. </p>
						<p> This cat is sweet and friendly, with the typically curious cat nature. He loves his family but isn’t demanding of attention. He’ll follow you around and show an interest in what you’re doing, and if you’d like to give him some lap time, well, he’s all in favor of that, too.  </p>
						<p> This is one of those cats who gets along with everyone, including dogs and other cats. He enjoys playing fetch and is willing to learn to walk on a leash, making him a great choice for anyone who travels frequently and would like to bring a feline companion along. </p>
						<p> They are well suited to any home with people who will love them and give their gorgeous coat a weekly combing.  </p>

							<h3> Cat's temperament and personality </h3>
							<p> The Maine Coon is sweet and friendly, with the typically curious cat nature. He is a sociable cat who loves his family but isn’t demanding of attention.

							<p> Maine Coons communicate with a variety of sounds. In addition to the all-purpose meows and purrs, you will hear them cheep, chirp and trill, incongruous sounds coming from a gentle giant. They use body language, too. A Maine Coon will give you a nice head butt to let you know just how special you are to him. </p>
							<p> Maine Coons can adapt to any type of home in any climate. They are built for cold outdoor living, but it’s safer to keep them inside so they don’t get hit by cars or run the risk of disease spread by other cats. </p>
							
							<h3> Grooming </h3>
							<p> The Maine Coon has a heavy, shaggy coat that’s silky to the touch. It rarely mats and weekly combing is all that’s needed to care for it. Combing removes the dead hairs that would otherwise be ingested by your cat when he bathes himself, resulting in hairballs. </p>
							<p> Cats can be prone to periodontal disease, so brush the teeth at home with a vet-approved pet toothpaste and schedule regular veterinary dental cleanings. </p>

						<a name="persian"> <h1> Persian cat </h1> </a>
						<p> The Persian is the most popular pedigreed cat in North America, if not the world.  The show Persian has a round head enhanced with a thick ruff, small ears, a flat nose, big round copper eyes, a broad, short body with heavy boning atop short tree-trunk legs, and a thick, flowing plume of a tail. </p>
						<p>  He’s not a jumper or climber, instead posing beautifully on a chair or sofa or playing with a favorite feather toy.  </p>
						<p> Children are acceptable to the Persian as long as they are content to simply pet him and not drag him around or dress him up. In general, just make sure children treat this cat with the gentle respect he deserves. </p>

							<h3> Cat's temperament and personality </h3>
							<p> Persians are gentle, quiet cats who like a serene environment and people who treat them kindly. Unlike more athletic cats, they prefer lounging on a sofa to scaling the heights of your bookcase or fireplace mantel. </p>
							<p> The Persian may greet you with a quiet meow, but in most cases he lets his eyes do the speaking for him. He doesn’t mind spending time alone, but your presence will always make him happy. When you go on a trip, it may be better to have a pet sitter come in and care for him in his own familiar surroundings than to board him in a strange place. </p>

							<h3> Grooming </h3>
							<p>  The long, flowing coat must be combed daily to prevent or remove mats and tangles. The Persian needs regular baths to stay clean and sweet-smelling. Introduce a kitten to bathing as soon as you bring him home so he will hopefully learn to accept it readily. </p>
							<p> In addition to daily combing, the Persian should be bathed weekly. Start this practice as soon as you get your kitten so hopefully he will come to look forward to it as a special part of spending time with you. </p>
							<p> Because of his pushed-in face, the Persian’s eyes can have a tendency to tear. To prevent ugly staining, wash or wipe his face daily, particularly beneath the eyes. Trim the nails as needed, and don't forget to brush the teeth regularly with a vet-approved pet toothpaste. </p>
